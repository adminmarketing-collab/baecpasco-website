          <p className="text-left   text-indent text-[18px] ">On May 1, 2012, Balagot & Co. took its first step outside Zamboanga, opening a branch in Davao City to <span className="text-[#f90908]">bring quality financial services to a wider audience at a more accessible cost</span>. The momentum continued in 2014 with the establishment of a Makati branch, strategically located at UGII Cityland Condominium 8, Sen.

It was about building a solid foundation anchored in trust and excellence.</span> Later that year, the firm strengthened its roots by opening a Kidapawan branch, closer to the hometown of its founder. This milestone was made possible with the collaboration of Cherry Mae Castro-Orella and Rezyl Mae Emperado-Tero, who took on the challenge of launching operations in December 2014, starting with just one client.</p>

          <p className="mb-20 text-left   text-indent text-[18px] ">In December 2018, <span className="text-[#f90908]">Koronadal Branch</span> was opened headed by Von Zerick Casero and Marissa Francisco.</p>
